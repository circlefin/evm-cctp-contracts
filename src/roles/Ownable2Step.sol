 * as base because this contract was added to OZ repo after version 0.8.0.
 *
 * Contract module which provides access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
 * can later be changed with {transferOwnership} and {acceptOwnership}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available all functions
 * from parent (Ownable).
